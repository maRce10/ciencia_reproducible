abstract = {Biologists often study phenotypic evolution assuming that phenotypes consist of a set of quasi-independent units that have been shaped by selection to accomplish a particular function. In the evolutionary literature, such quasi-independent functional units are called 'evolutionary characters', and a framework based on evolutionary principles has been developed to characterize them. This framework mainly focuses on 'fixed' characters, i.e. those that vary exclusively between individuals. In this paper, we introduce multi-level variation and thereby expand the framework to labile characters, focusing on behaviour as a worked example. We first propose a concept of 'behavioural characters' based on the original evolutionary character concept. We then detail how integration of variation between individuals (cf. 'personality') and within individuals (cf. 'individual plasticity') into the framework gives rise to a whole suite of novel testable predictions about the evolutionary character concept. We further propose a corresponding statistical methodology to test whether observed behaviours should be considered expressions of a hypothesized evolutionary character. We illustrate the application of our framework by characterizing the behavioural character 'aggressiveness' in wild great tits, Parus major.},

@article{Eberhard2009,
abstract = {A survey of 117 species of arthropods and 17 species of vertebrates showed a strong trend for male genitalia to have relatively low static allometric values. This trend contrasts with the allometry of other structures under sexual selection, which usually show steep allometric slopes. The trend to low allometric genital values is less consistent in mammals than in arthropods. Data not in accord with the previous the "one-size-fits-all" explanation for low allometric slopes in genitalia, which was based on sexual selection by female choice, suggest a more general version that includes both natural selection and sexual selection, and involves both mechanical fit and stimulation. Less-complete data on the female genitalia of arthropods suggest a trend to similar low allometric slopes, and may also be explained by mechanical fit and stimulatory one-size-fits-all arguments.},

@article{Chaverri2013,
abstract = {Acoustic signals are important in maintaining group cohesion, particularly in highly mobile species. For these signals to facilitate group cohesion, individuals must be able to recognize, and respond to, calls emitted by group members. In this study, we document the use and recognition of complementary contact calls in Spix's disc-winged bat (Thyroptera tricolor), a species known to form very stable social groups despite using an extremely ephemeral roosting resource. This bat uses 2 sets of calls: “inquiry,” which are emitted by flying bats that are seeking roosts or group mates, and “response,” which are produced in reply to an inquiry call by individuals that have already located a roost. Here, we test if bats are capable of discriminating between the inquiry and response calls of group and nongroup mates using playback experiments. Results show that flying bats can discriminate between the inquiry and response calls emitted by group and nongroup members and can maintain contact preferentially with the former. Roosting bats, however, exhibited no preference for group over nongroup members and thus responded indiscriminately. We argue that differences in how individuals respond to calls from group and nongroup members may be partly attributed to the costs associated with flight and the potential benefits of recruiting roost mates.},
